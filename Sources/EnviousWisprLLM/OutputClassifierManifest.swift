/// The classifier is the Phase-3 winner: a MiniLM-L6 cross-encoder (seed 13)
/// that scores an (instruction, polished-output) pair and flags cases where
/// Apple Intelligence composed an artifact instead of cleaning the dictation.
///
/// Provenance (durable artifact tree, not committed here):
///   `~/Developer/EnviousLabs/EnviousWispr-artifacts/issue-832-classifier-probe/`
///   - model:     `phase3-models/MiniLM-L6-reformat2-13/fixed.mlpackage` (#949 retrain)
///   - tokenizer: `phase2-models/MiniLM-L6-13/checkpoint-best/{tokenizer.json,tokenizer_config.json}`
///     (UNCHANGED — same base; tokenizer folder + contract not re-shipped)
///   - threshold: `phase2-models/MiniLM-L6-reformat2-13/eval.json` → `T_clf`
///
/// #949 retrain (2026-06-02): same MiniLM-L6 seed 13, fine-tuned one gentle epoch
/// (lr 2e-5) on the v5 corpus + ~3.1k synthesized faithful-reformat KEEP pairs and
/// adversarial unfaithful-reformat DISCARD pairs, so faithful contact-block reformats
/// (phone/date/address) score KEEP instead of being discarded as composed. No-regression
/// gates green: locked-test discard-recall 98.67% (floor 98.5%; shipped 98.89%), KEEP
/// FPR-95 2.77%, reformat false-discard 67.5% → 3.0%, Core ML drift 0 band-flips.
///
/// The model ships as `OutputClassifier.mlpackage` in the APP bundle's
/// `Contents/Resources` (an app-target folder reference) and is compiled to a
/// `.mlmodelc` on-device at prewarm. See the PR8 runbook refresh addendum for
