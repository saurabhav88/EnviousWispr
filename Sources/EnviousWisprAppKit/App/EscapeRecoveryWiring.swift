/// Extracted rather than inlined in `WisprBootstrapper` because that file's
/// ceiling caught it, which is exactly what the ceiling is for — #1988 set the
/// precedent when live-preview wiring hit the same cap and moved to
/// `LivePreviewInstaller` instead of raising it. The composition root holds
/// dependencies together; it does not implement features.
///
/// Deliberately tiny and stateless. It owns no lifecycle, makes no decisions, and
/// exists so that "which store writes the marker" is answered in one place for
/// both the kernel connector and `RecoveryCoordinator`.

  /// recovery coordinator can never end up pointed at different directories — a

  /// Returns whether the marker is durably on disk. `false` means the caller
  /// performs today's ordinary destructive cancel — see
  /// `RecoverySpoolStore.prepareEscapeRecovery` for why failure destroys the
  /// spool rather than leaving one with no provenance.
  /// `makeStore` is a parameter with a production default so a test can point the
  /// writer at a temp directory. Without it this composition would be untestable
  /// by construction — the only way to exercise it would be to write into the
  /// real user's recovery directory, which no test may do.
