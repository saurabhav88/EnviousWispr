/// Characterizes `CustomWordSuggestionFlow` — the piece of
/// `CustomWordEditSheet`'s Add-term/Edit-word suggestion flow this PR's
/// migration actually touches (#1701 Grounded Review Chunk 1). The founder
/// authorized extracting this piece into a directly testable unit after the
/// reviewer stopped the build for skipping the plan's required Add-term
/// characterization test; the surrounding debounce and loading-indicator
/// choreography stays inline in the view, unchanged, and is covered by
/// Live UAT instead (not unit-testable — no established pattern in this
/// codebase for driving a SwiftUI `.task(id:)` body directly).
///
/// `fetch`'s `suggest` is injected as a plain closure — deterministic, no
/// live FoundationModels call — while the production call site in
/// `CustomWordEditSheet.swift` is what pins the actual `priority: .interactive`
/// argument (grep-verified in the Chunk 1 receipt); the dedicated permit-queue
/// suite (`WordSuggestionServiceTests.swift`) separately proves `.interactive`
/// is served ahead of `.background`.
///
/// `@testable import EnviousWisprPostProcessing` (not a widened public API,
/// Grounded Review Chunk 1 round 2 finding) is what makes `WordSuggestions`'s
/// existing internal memberwise initializer reachable here, matching the
/// established pattern in `ContactsImportCoordinatorTests.swift`.
