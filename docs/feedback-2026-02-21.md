# User Feedback & Bug Reports — 2026-02-21

## Bugs

### Bug 1: ESC doesn't cancel recording started from menu bar
- Steps: Click mic icon → "Start Recording" or "Record + AI Polish"
- Expected: ESC cancels recording
- Actual: Only push-to-talk button stops it

### Bug 5: Conflicting ASR model status indicators
- Left sidebar: green "Parakeet v3 · Loaded"
- Top bar: red "Error Parakeet v3"
- No way to see error details from the UI

### Bug 7: Paste button in detail view doesn't work
- Copy works, Paste does nothing with an empty text field focused in another app

## UI/Feature Requests

### Feature 2: Transcript history list improvements
- **2a:** Double the height of each transcript row
- **2b:** Wrap transcript text instead of truncating with "..."
- **2c:** Replace generic purple "AI" badge with actual LLM model name

### Feature 3: Remove "Avg Speed" metric from header
- The 0.1s display is not useful — remove it

### Feature 4: Show original transcript prominently in detail view
- Currently a hidden disclosure ("Show original")
- Show expanded by default alongside polished copy
- Make visually prominent

### Feature 6: Show LLM model name in detail view header
- "Enhanced" label should display which LLM model was used (e.g., "GPT-4o Enhanced")

### Feature 8: Microphone button needs better affordance
- Purpose unclear until pressed
- Needs label, tooltip, or design hint (e.g., "Record" text beneath it)

### Bug 9: >> button behavior broken + header redesign
- Clicking ">>" should minimize the search bar, but instead shows a "Record" popover with "Error"
- **Redesign proposal:** Since Avg Speed is being removed (Feature 3), repurpose the entire header stats area as an always-visible search bar (no expand/collapse needed)
- Move transcript count to where the current search icon is (top right area)

### Feature 10: Add "Delete All" transcripts button
- No way to bulk-delete all transcripts currently
- Add a "Delete All" button with a confirmation dialog ("Are you sure?")
