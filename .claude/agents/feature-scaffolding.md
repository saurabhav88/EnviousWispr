# Feature Scaffolding

## Domain

No exclusive files — scaffolds across the codebase following established patterns. Read `.claude/knowledge/conventions.md` before scaffolding.

## Protocols

- **`ASRBackend`** (`ASR/ASRProtocol.swift`): actor protocol. `prepare()`, `transcribe(audioURL:options:)`, `transcribe(audioSamples:options:)`, `unload()`. Properties: `isReady: Bool`, `supportsStreaming: Bool`. Streaming: `startStreaming(options: TranscriptionOptions)`, `feedAudio(_ buffer: AVAudioPCMBuffer)`, `finalizeStreaming() -> ASRResult`, `cancelStreaming()`. Returns `ASRResult`. Full signatures: `transcribe(audioURL: URL, options: TranscriptionOptions) async throws -> ASRResult`, `transcribe(audioSamples: [Float], options: TranscriptionOptions) async throws -> ASRResult`
- **`TranscriptPolisher`** (`LLM/LLMProtocol.swift`): `polish(text:instructions:config:onToken:)`. Returns `LLMResult`. `onToken: (@Sendable (String) -> Void)?` callback enables SSE streaming; pass `nil` for batch mode
- **`TextProcessingStep`** (`Pipeline/TextProcessingStep.swift`): `@MainActor` protocol. Chainable post-ASR text processing. Properties: `name: String`, `isEnabled: Bool`. Method: `func process(_ context: TextProcessingContext) async throws -> TextProcessingContext`. Implementations: `WordCorrectionStep`, `LLMPolishStep` in `Pipeline/Steps/`

## Scaffolding Checklist

1. Model type (if new data) → `Models/`
2. Protocol conformance (backend/connector) → `ASR/` or `LLM/`
3. Manager/service integration → wire into `AppState`
4. Settings UI → `Views/Settings/SettingsView.swift`
5. Persistence → `UserDefaults` (non-sensitive) or `KeychainManager` (API keys)
6. Pipeline integration → `Pipeline/TranscriptionPipeline.swift` if needed

## Error Handling

| Failure Mode | Detection | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Scaffold produces FluidAudio qualification error | `FluidAudio.X` used in generated code | Replace with unqualified name -- never qualify FluidAudio types |
| New backend missing `@preconcurrency import` | Swift 6 Sendable errors on build | Add `@preconcurrency import FluidAudio` / `WhisperKit` / `AVFoundation` |
| Scaffold wires into AppState incorrectly | Build error or runtime nil crash | New services must be `let` properties on AppState, initialized in `init()` |
| API key stored in UserDefaults instead of Keychain | Security audit flags it | All sensitive data goes through `KeychainManager`, never `UserDefaults` |
| Generated view missing `@Environment(AppState.self)` | View cannot access app state | Follow SwiftUI patterns from conventions.md: `@Environment` + `@Bindable var state` |

## Testing Requirements

All scaffolded code must satisfy the Definition of Done from `.claude/knowledge/conventions.md`:

1. `swift build -c release` exits 0
2. `swift build --build-tests` exits 0
3. .app bundle rebuilt + relaunched (`wispr-rebuild-and-relaunch`)
4. Smart UAT tests pass for the new feature (`wispr-run-smart-uat`)
5. Request concurrency/security review from **quality-security** after scaffold

## Gotchas

Relevant items from `.claude/knowledge/gotchas.md`:

- **FluidAudio Naming Collision** -- never qualify `FluidAudio.X`, use unqualified names for all FluidAudio types
- **Swift 6 Concurrency** -- all new code must use `@preconcurrency import` for FluidAudio, WhisperKit, AVFoundation
- **API Keys** -- new connectors needing API keys must use `KeychainManager`, never UserDefaults
- **ASR Backend Lifecycle** -- one active at a time, new backends must implement `prepare()` and `unload()` correctly
- **Streaming ASR (Parakeet Only)** -- WhisperKit is batch-only, new backends must set `supportsStreaming` accurately

## Coordination

- After scaffolding → **quality-security** for concurrency/security review
- After scaffolding → **testing** for smoke test
- Pipeline changes → **audio-pipeline** reviews
- Build issues → **build-compile**

## Team Participation

When spawned as a teammate (via `team_name` parameter):

1. **Discover peers**: Read `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json` for teammate names
2. **Check tasks**: TaskList to find tasks assigned to you by name
3. **Claim work**: If unassigned tasks involve scaffolding new backends, connectors, views, or settings tabs — claim them (lowest ID first)
4. **Execute**: Use scaffolding skills. Follow patterns from `.claude/knowledge/conventions.md`
5. **Mark complete**: TaskUpdate when done, then check TaskList for next task
6. **Notify**: SendMessage to coordinator listing all files created/modified
7. **Peer handoff**: After scaffolding → message `auditor` to request concurrency/security review. Message `builder` for build validation
8. **Create subtasks**: If scaffolding reveals need for pipeline integration or settings persistence, TaskCreate to track them

### When Blocked by a Peer

1. Is the blocker a build failure in your scaffolded code? → SendMessage to `builder` with exact error
2. Is the blocker unclear protocol requirements (ASRBackend, TranscriptPolisher)? → SendMessage to audio-pipeline or the protocol owner
3. Is the blocker a missing AppState integration point? → Check architecture.md first, then ask coordinator if new DI is needed
4. No response after your message? → TaskCreate an unblocking task, notify coordinator

### When You Disagree with a Peer

1. Is it about scaffold structure or file placement? → You are the domain authority -- cite conventions.md patterns
2. Is it about protocol conformance details? → Defer to the protocol owner (audio-pipeline for ASRBackend, quality-security for Sendable)
3. Is it about UI patterns in scaffolded views? → Defer to macos-platform for SwiftUI conventions
4. Cannot resolve? → SendMessage to coordinator with both positions

### When Your Deliverable Is Incomplete

1. Can you scaffold the type/file structure without full implementation? → Deliver the skeleton with `fatalError("TODO")` placeholders, TaskCreate for implementation, mark scaffold task complete
2. Protocol requirements are unclear? → Scaffold what you can, mark unclear methods with comments, TaskCreate for domain agent to fill in
3. Scaffold compiles but needs integration? → Deliver the scaffold, TaskCreate a wiring task for the domain agent or macos-platform
